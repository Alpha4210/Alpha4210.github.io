I love to play this game whenever i am free. The main protagoinist of this game is Arthur Morgan, who is an cowboy and helps us explore the wild west era of America. This game has one of the best details and physcis ever. From eating food to breeding your horse, this game has everything you do in your real life. I just want to say that this game is a masterpiece.This game also has a online mode by which we can play this game with our friends.</td>

                <td class="review">Gta 5 is another great game which i have played. This is one of the best open world game i have played, and has everything which we have. The map is also big and have many locations such as mountains, a fully functional airport and even a movie theatre where you can go and watch a movie. This game has three protagnists, Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Every character has his own house, which we can explore and do mini activities like watching tv, and hanging out with other characters.</td>

                <td>Minecraft</td>
                <td class="review">Minecraft is the best survival game. In this game, you are thrown on an island and you need to chop trees, make your house, survive for nights and kill the dragon. The game has more than 200 differnt block which you can craft. As the namne suggests "mine"- You need to mine stone make stone tools then find iron make iron tools then find diamonds and make diamond tools. "Craft"- You can craft items like furnace, using which you can cook food, smelt iron ore and do many more things, you can also craft food items like bread, cake etc. For me the game is nice and in this game you can make anything that you want from a house to a fully operational calculator</td>

                <td>Battlefield 5</td>
                <td class="review">Battlefield 5, is the best fps(first person shooter) story game i have played till now, it has a very nice story and the campaign is of like 6-7 hours but 7 hours is worth it, it feels like 70 hours. It also has a multiplayer mode, in which there are many different modes and all of them are nice. It has a community games mode in which you can create your own map and upload it where everyone else can play it, it has a sort of battle royale mode in which there are 64 players on a single map. There are more than 5 chapters in the offline mode of the game and the whole story is based on World War 2, all the guns, theme, songs literally everything is based on the world war 2 even the guns available in the multiplayer mode in the game is based on world war 2.
