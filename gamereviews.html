It has a community games mode in which you can create your own map and upload it where everyone else can play it, it has a sort of battle royale mode in which there are 64 players on a single map. There are more than 5 chapters in the offline mode of the game and the whole story is based on World War 2, all the guns, theme, songs literally everything is based on the world war 2 even the guns available in the multiplayer mode in the game is based on world war 2.
